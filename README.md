📌 AI-Driven Web Platform and Accessible Care for Children with disabilities

A smart web platform that helps families of children with disabilities quickly find nearby, accessible education and care institutions based on their specific needs.
Instead of endless searching, phone calls, and uncertainty — this platform gives clear, personalized, and reliable results in one place.
🌟 Why This Project?
Finding the right school or care center for a child with disabilities is time-consuming and stressful.
Most existing platforms:
Don’t focus on accessibility
Lack disability-specific filters
Provide generic, non-personalized results
This project solves that by combining AI, location services, and accessibility-focused design.
